##EDAMAME: Community sampling (rarefaction) and diversity learning activity

Congratulations!  You and your colleagues have discovered a novel community of microorganisms inhabiting the core of a Martian rock.  At first glance, there seems to be very high diversity in the community.  To understand the diversity of the new community, you and your colleagues decide to divide the rock into equal parts and independently evaluate the diversity of each subsample, and then calculate the total diversity at the end, across all of the subsamples.  This will provide a more comprehensive, and hopefully, more accurate view of total diversity.  Your mission:  you have a subsample of the community observed from the Martian rock and you must evaluate it!

###1.  As an individual investigator, observe the number of different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their abundances in the subsample, and record it into the shared [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1hQvrzW_lwpJRWF7a2pgTBoW0cnzsg1qwKy0YmiuyA/edit#gid=0) <br>

Be precise about identifying your OTUs – note any distinguishing features (such as size, color, flavor, and type) in the descriptor column.  Some of your OTUs will overlap with those already observed by your colleagues, and these OTUs will coincide in the row in which they are recorded. Destructive sampling may be necessary to accurately identify OTUs.  Use whatever methods available to come to an accurate identification.  

* (i)	Record your subsample information it the Google Sheet <br>
* (ii)	What is the richness of your subsample? <br>
* (iii)	What is the community size (number of individuals) in your subsample? <br>
* (iv)	How many singletons – taxa that are observed only once- did you observe in your subsample? <br>


###2.  Within your Table, calculate the following community parameters about the rock community, using the information from all subsamples collectively.

* (i)	What is the richness of the community? <br>
* (ii)	What is the size of the community (total number of individuals)? <br>
* (iii)	How many singletons does the community have? <br>
* (iv)	Which is the most abundant OTU, and how many individuals does it have?  What proportion of the community does it comprise? <br>
* (v)	What are the mean and median abundances of OTUs? <br>


###3A .  Within your Table, plot a sampling (rarefaction) curve of the data.  You may use a spreadsheet or statistics software to do this, or you can draft it by hand.

* (i)	What kind of data visualization that this is (e.g., pie chart – no, it will not be a pie chart)? <br>
* (ii)	What is the x-axis? <br>
* (iii)	What is the y-axis? <br>
* (iv)	In one sentence, summarize the results.  What insights have you gained from the visualization about how completely you have sampled the Martian community? <br>
